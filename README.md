# QUSSI
a forest tool
In this study, we tried to develop a forest dynamic growth simulation tool at the stand level by using the computer language Python, and applied this tool to simulate the stand growth situation in the Qinling Huoditang forest area. The research uses computer language Python, based on Visual Studio Code visual integrated development environment (IDE), through model linking and system integration, using Tkinter module to design graphical interface, and develop a forest dynamic growth simulation tool. The application of this tool realizes the generation of various forestry tables for different tree species, and predicts Pinus tabulaeformis, Pinus armandii, Quercus aliena and Tsuga chinensis in the Huoditang forest area of Qinling Mountains. The growth process of the stand, as well as the dynamic changes of biomass and carbon storage of each organ component of the forest, can also simulate the diameter order distribution of different-aged pine and oak mixed forests in the Qinling area and the impact of different management schemes on the diameter order distribution.
